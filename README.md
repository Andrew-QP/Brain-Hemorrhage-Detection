# Brain-Hemorrhage-Detection

This study proposes several types of traditional learning models as well as neural networks used to predict if a patient has a brain hemorrhage or not. All of these models utilized the same dataset of a little under 7000 grayscale images at a resolution of 512 x 512. The validation set was tested across all models, yielding measurable data to inform a comprehensive comparison. The two traditional learning models used were Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression while three neural networks were used. Those three include Convolution Neural network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Attention RNN. It was found that CNN performed the best out of all five models with a validation accuracy of 73.1%. Surprisingly, the other neural networks performed similarly to the traditional learning models where the average validation accuracy of those models were  57.3%. We therefore find CNN as the optimal model for predicting brain hemorrhages as it can pick up complex patterns from images better than traditional learning models and the other neural networks.
